      <h2>About Jemma</h2>
      <p>
        Jemma is a 7-year-old female cat who has been my companion since she was
        a kitten. She has a strong personality but is truly a love bug at heart.
        Recently, I noticed her constantly licking her lips and rubbing her
        mouth, which led me to take her to the vet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, she is in urgent need of dental surgery, and I cannot
        afford it alone. The vet has estimated the total cost to be $2,316,
        covering extractions, medication, and follow-up care. My goal is to
        relieve her pain and ensure she continues living a happy, healthy life.
      </p>

        Any donation, big or small, would mean the world to Jemma and me. If you
        can't donate, sharing this fundraiser would be an incredible help. Thank
        you so much for your kindness and support!
